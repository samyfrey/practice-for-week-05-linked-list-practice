# Practice Linked Lists Part 3

In this three-part exercise, your task is to implement the constructor,
`addToHead` and `addToTail` function for a `LinkedList` and a
`DoublyLinkedList`.

Read the specs for details.

## Instructions

1. Continue working in the [starter] repo as part 1 and 2

## Part 3: Comparing performance

Identify the time complexity of `addToHead` and `addToTail` for both the
single and doubly linked lists.

Construct a timing test in `linked-list-timing.js` to verify your hypothesis.

There are no test specs for this.
